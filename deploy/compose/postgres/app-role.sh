# One-shot, every start: the login role Keeper and Scribe connect as.
#
# POSTGRES_USER, created by the image, is a superuser: it owns the schema, runs the migrations
# and the index maintenance, and skips row-level security. The services connect as APP_USER
# instead, a role without SUPERUSER, BYPASSRLS, CREATEDB, CREATEROLE or REPLICATION, so the
# `domain_isolation` policies apply to every statement they run. The role may read and write
# the rows of the tables in the public schema (present and future ones, through default
# privileges of the owner) and nothing else, except UPDATE and DELETE on audit_log, which is
# append-only (revision 0015); revision 0005 grants it EXECUTE on the read functions when the
# migration runs with database.application_role set to it.
#
# The script is idempotent and runs before the migrations on every `up`, so it also works on a
# volume created before this role existed and picks up a changed APP_PASSWORD.
#
# Environment: PGHOST, POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD, POSTGRES_DB, APP_USER, APP_PASSWORD.
