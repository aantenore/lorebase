# One-shot guard of an optional profile: exits 1, naming the variable, unless every secret named
# in the arguments is set to a real value. Compose interpolation cannot require a variable only
# when a profile is enabled (`${VAR:?}` fails for every profile), so the services that need a
# secret depend on this check instead and never start with an empty or placeholder value.
#
# Usage: require-secrets.sh NAME...   (each NAME is an environment variable of the container)
# Environment: the named variables; SECRET_MIN_LENGTH (default 16).
